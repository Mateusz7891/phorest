In order to run tests you need to have:
a)Python 3.10 (at least)
b)Playwright
c)Virtual environemnt

Choosen technology Python + Playworght allowed me to write test fast. 
Code is reuable, one can really easy add new tests to it with use of Builder Pattern , and defined Objects.
I would also add gmail integration to check content of sended emails - but it requires creating new gmail accounts and around 3-4 hours of work more (with gmail tester, mailosaur). As I had information that this whole task
shoudl take me around 3-4 hours total. The other way of checking Mails is to create API interceptor od send emails
